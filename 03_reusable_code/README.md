# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

Deliverable 3: Reusable `R` code wrapped in an `R` package or `Shiny` app.

- If `R` package, link the package website and your development repository (on GitHub).
- If `Shiny app`, link the app on a `Shiny` server and your development repository (on GitHub).

See course manual for requirements.

I have opted for an `R` package, the website for which can be found [here](https://adlieben.github.io/academicRules/index.html) and the development repository [here](https://github.com/Adlieben/academicRules/tree/v1.0.0). As of 19/01/2025, zenodo is returning an error when seeking to publish anything so the package is unpublished.
