## Who am I?

I am Adam Maghout, a student at the UU. My ORCID is 0009-0002-5241-0856.

## What am I?

A sentient being. My favourite equation is this one:

$E = mc^2 + \text{AI}$

This equation highlights the potential for AI to unlock new forms of energy, enhance scientific discoveries, and revolutionize various fields such as healthcare, transportation, and technology.

## Want to know something more about me?

I started learning guitar when I was five. But I nearly gave up at 13. Good thing I didn't because otherwise I wouldn't be a failing part-time musician now.
