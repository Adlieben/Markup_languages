  abstract = {One important step for assessing the quality of a test is to examine the reliability of test score interpretation. Which aspect of reliability is the most relevant depends on what type of test it is and how the scores are to be used. For criterion-referenced tests, and in particular certification tests, where students are classified into performance categories, primary focus need not be on the size of error but on the impact of this error on classification. This impact can be described in terms of classification consistency and classification accuracy. In this article selected methods from classical test theory for estimating classification consistency and classification accuracy were applied to the theory part of the Swedish driving licence test, a high-stakes criterion-referenced test which is rarely studied in terms of reliability of classification. The results for this particular test indicated a level of classification consistency that falls slightly short of the recommended level which is why lengthening the test should be considered. More evidence should also be gathered as to whether the placement of the cut-off score is appropriate since this has implications for the validity of classifications.},

  abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) is widely used in assessment and evaluation research to explain how participants respond to item level stimuli. Several R packages can be used to estimate the parameters in various IRT models, the most flexible being the ltm (Rizopoulos 2006), eRm (Mair and Hatzinger 2007), and MCMCpack (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011) packages. However these packages have limitations in that ltm and eRm can only analyze unidimensional IRT models effectively and the exploratory multidimensional extensions available in MCMCpack requires prior understanding of Bayesian estimation convergence diagnostics and are computationally intensive. Most importantly, multidimensional confirmatory item factor analysis methods have not been implemented in any R package. The mirt package was created for estimating multidimensional item response theory parameters for exploratory and confirmatory models by using maximum-likelihood meth- ods. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature method used in traditional EM estimation (e.g., Bock and Aitkin 1981) is presented for exploratory item response models as well as for confirmatory bifactor models (Gibbons and Hedeker 1992). Exploratory and confirmatory models are estimated by a stochastic algorithm described by Cai (2010a,b). Various program comparisons are presented and future directions for the package are discussed.},

Tests divisible into distinct subtests should be so divided before using the formula. Comparison is made to the Guttman and Loevinger approaches. Parallel split coefficients are shown to be unnecessary for tests of common types. In designing tests, maximum interpretability of scores is obtained by increasing the first-factor concentration in any separately-scored subtest and avoiding substantial group-factor clusters within a subtest.

An assortment of potential economic and psychological consequences are linked with holding a student back. Here we focus exclusively on the economic consequences of retention, building a framework for analyzing the societal implications of retention. Using this framework, we present broad estimates of what the benefits of grade retention would have to be in order to make it a cost-effective practice.}

  abstract = {This paper examines the mounting crisis of student mental health issues stemming from extreme exam pressure, which has risen to the level of an international epidemic. Quantitative indicators make clear both the severity and global nature of the crisis. Suicide ranks as the leading cause of death for those aged 15 to 39 around the world, with over 800,000 people dying of suicide every year. Alarmingly, suicide attempts by teenagers spike during exam periods across numerous developed countries. In India, student suicide rates rose an astonishing 70\% from 2011 to 2021 alone, with over 13,000 students taking their lives in 2021 or roughly 35 deaths daily. Studies directly tie as much as 8\% of these suicides to exam stress. Similarly stark correlations between self-harm/suicide attempts and exam periods appear for secondary students in Canada, England, South Korea, and China which holds notoriously demanding university entrance examinations. Rates of psychiatric hospitalizations also climb among teens in Canada and England during these high-pressure exam terms. The roots of this crisis reflect the immense pressure placed on students by sociocultural attitudes framing exam success as a life-defining goal. Across Eastern and Western cultures alike, families, communities, and nations signal to youth that their value and future security depend overwhelmingly on aceing standardized tests, outcompeting peers, and gaining admission to elite institutions of higher education. Testing assumes an outsized role as the chief determinant and gateway to overall life outcomes. This pressure cooker environment breeds immense stress and anxiety while largely neglecting student emotional health and framing self-worth in reductionist terms of exam mastery. Research shows supportive school climates and teaching test-coping techniques cannot compensate fully for these engrained societal mindsets. To counter such a complex international problem, solutions must address root cultural drivers head-on through coordinated local, national, and global initiatives: reframing societal messaging around testing's purpose to students' self-concept and inherent worth; policies explicitly prioritizing student mental health alongside academic achievement; decoupling tests from automatic life trajectories; student-centered holistic learning models; family and community engagement. With concerted efforts on these sociocultural fronts combined with strong youth voices speaking out, the epidemic of examrelated stress threatening students worldwide can recede. This paper issues an urgent call to action to intervene against a truly global crisis and hidden epidemic carrying grave costs for our future generations.},

The empirical equivalence scale suggests that the official UCAS tariff is too generous to IB students in the allocation of UCAS points. We also compare the points of IB students with the UCAS scores of A level students in the same university. We find that the amount that the official tariff is adjusted by universities is approximately correct in the low-to-middle part of the range (IB points in the low 30s). At the top end of the scale, however, universities have adjusted too far away from the official mapping. Oxford and Cambridge are exceptions, owing to their intensive recruitment methods; yet their tendency to ask for very high IB points, but not very high A level UCAS points, remains a puzzle.},

Among other reasons, that the computation of {$\omega$} is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of {$\alpha$} versus {$\omega$}, we illustrate the computation of {$\omega$} using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and AMOS) and the MBESS package for R. We then describe a macro for SPSS and SAS (OMEGA) that calculates {$\omega$} in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using CFA. We show that it produces estimates of {$\omega$} that are nearly identical to when using CFA-based estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the OMEGA macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale.}

After a review of the literature, the authors found the IB Diploma Programme has been studied in many countries by both consultants and educational agencies, and also by a wide array of universities themselves; however, there are fewer qualitative studies concerning the degree to which IB graduates display attitudes, values, and behaviours in line with the IB Learner Profile. This is why the authors stress the claims made are supported by examples of significant research, noting that there is a dearth of qualitative longitudinal studies to sufficiently substantiate the affective domain claims that currently rely more on anecdotal evidence. The authors conclude by pointing out more research is needed in order to substantiate anecdotal evidence regarding future employment success for IB Diploma Programme graduates.},

Another purpose is to examine relative performances of the IRT reliability statistics and two classical test theory (CTT) reliability statistics (Cronbach's alpha and Feldt--Gilmer congeneric coefficients) under various testing conditions that result from manipulating large-scale real data. For the first purpose, two alternative ways of exactly quantifying {$\rho$}XX{$\prime$} are compared in terms of computational efficiency and statistical usefulness. In addition, the lower and upper bounds for {$\rho$}XX{$\prime$} are presented in line with the assumptions of essential tau-equivalence and congeneric similarity, respectively. Empirical studies conducted for the second purpose showed across all testing conditions that (1) the IRT reliability coefficient was higher than the CTT reliability statistics; (2) the IRT reliability coefficient was closer to the Feldt--Gilmer coefficient than to the Cronbach's alpha coefficient; and (3) the alpha coefficient was close to the lower bound of IRT reliability. Some advantages of the IRT approach to estimating test-score reliability over the CTT approaches are discussed in the end.},

This special issue helps to address this lacuna. This introductory paper highlights the contradictions between international students as `desired' because of their internationalism and fee contributions, and as `unwanted' because of the politics of migration control especially in the context of the securitisation of study in the post 9/11 scenario. It argues that interrogating the terms `international' and `students' is critical to addressing the slipperiness that underlies these contradictions. Focusing on students per se ignores their multiple roles, as family members, actual or potential workers, or perhaps refugees and asylum-seekers, while definitions of international students ignore the diversity of study that students undertake. After summarising the papers that follow, this paper concludes with an agenda for future research on ISM: greater theoretical insight drawing on the cognate field of mobility studies; more in-depth ethnographic research on mobile students who recognise their multiple roles in knowledge diffusion and social reproduction; further research on ISM datasets and quantitative surveys, which employs statistical analysis; more attention paid to gender and race as they relate to ISM; and a stronger link to pedagogy and systems of higher education and knowledge production.

The aim of the study on which this article is based was to examine the extent to which the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is effective at delivering the IB mission statement. Literature has first been reviewed in order to explore the aims of international education and how curricula and school systems can influence the development of values within students. Within the review, concepts are explored and compared to the IBDP. The literature review concludes with a model reflecting the influences on the promotion of international education within a school. The article then describes a case study carried out in an international school that delivers the IBDP, using a mixed methods approach with an exploratory sequential design. A small number of IBDP students were interviewed, and the findings of these interviews were triangulated using a questionnaire completed by all Diploma Programme students in the case study school. The results of the student interviews and questionnaires were used as the basis for ascertaining the ways in which the IBDP has influenced student attitudes.The study concludes that the values of the students in question were moving towards those expressed in the IB mission statement. The significance of different elements of the school curriculum and the school environment for the development of values within the student population has been highlighted as an area for possible further research.},

The main contention of this interpretive model is that the IB Diploma needs to be understood as a credential (rather than solely as a curriculum) and its diffusion contextualised within the specific educational and social structures of each country in which it is found. Following an analysis of the global distribution of IB Diploma schools and students, I review the most ambitious attempt to characterise the international distribution of the IB Diploma to date, highlighting its strengths and limitations. I then exemplify how contextualising the IB Diploma within national education system structures can be carried out in practice. This provides the foundation for the international overview of the relationship between the IB Diploma and academic distinction in the next chapter.},

A simulation study using a single scale was performed on data with n\,=\,60, 80, 120, 200, 300, 500 and 900 cases utilizing 4, 8, 16 or 32 items. A total of 10\% of each item had missing values vs. there were no missing data. Skewness of the items were 0, 1 and 2. Correlations were homogenous vs. heterogeneous. Standard deviations were homogenous vs. heterogeneous. Underlying constructs were homogenous vs. heterogenous. Conditions were combined in a block design, and 1000 replications for each one were calculated. As a result, alpha slightly underestimated reliability in some cases, omega minimally overestimated in large samples, the GLB overestimated strongly in small samples. Additionally, GLB estimates had less precision within the 1000 replications, i.e., standard deviations were almost double as large as for alpha and omega. Interestingly, the performances of alpha and omega were basically similar. However, various programs showed different results particularly in cases with missing data on the items. Out of the programs examined, the R package MBESS displayed best results.},

This latter is the situation in the system of final examinations for secondary education in the Netherlands and is used as an example in this paper. This examination system consists of several school-specific and central parts. A method is presented for quantifying measurement precision for multiple tests in terms of a classification table of true and observed classifications. With this method the percentage of students that is either correctly or incorrectly classified by the tests being administered can be estimated. The method is used to assess the effects of different pass/fail decision rules by application to data from high stakes examinations in pre-university education in 2008. The results are mixed, but generally indicate good properties of compensatory aspects of decision rules. Implications of the results are discussed.},

This article analyses to what extent examples from international assessments and other countries' results have been used as arguments for school policy change in Germany and Sweden. The conclusion is that both countries, after undergoing a ``PISA shock'', found justification for changes in their education policy by referring to other countries. Their views of how to solve the problem (i.e., the drop in results) were also similar: increased management and control of parts of the education system, albeit by different means.},

The increase in such schools is complemented by the evolution of the ``international curriculum'' themselves. Two of the most common curricula that are used by international schools are the focus of investigation - the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) and the International Advanced-Levels (IAL). Through an analysis of the curricula history, curricula set-up, and the teaching and learning of the curricula, this paper argues that the IBDP can be seen as moving from an idealist and internationalist curriculum towards a more pragmatic and globalist curriculum, while the IAL has always been a strongly globalist curriculum. Completing the IBDP or IAL is increasingly seen simply as a pathway towards entry into an internationally recognised university.},
