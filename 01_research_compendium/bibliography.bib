  abstract = {When landlords always win and renters pay the price, what can be done?Housing means prosperity and security for some; poverty, precarity and sickness for others. More people live in private rented accommodation than ever before, and rents rise without apparent reason. Homes are smaller every year, and nearly 20 per cent of tenants live in hazardous conditions. Homelessness is at a new high. Yet the government's only solution is to promote homeownership.Against Landlords shows that this crisis is not the product of happenstance or political incompetence. Government policy has intentionally split British citizens into homeowners and renters, two classes set on very different financial paths. In the UK, one out of every twenty-one adults is a landlord, and it is this group, and those who aspire to join it, represented by the political class.In his radical new interpretation of the housing crisis, lawyer Nick Bano explains how this environment set the conditions for the Grenfell Tower fire and how it means a life of anxiety for the nation's renters. It is a problem that stretches far beyond London and one inherently racist in nature.Building more housing is not the solution. It is firstly a problem of the law, Bano argues, and reforms must sweep away the landlordism at the heart of the housing crisis and British political life.},

  abstract = {This article presents a model agnostic methodology for producing property price indices. The motivation to develop this methodology is to include non-linear and non-parametric models, such as Machine Learning (ML), in the pool of algorithms to produce price indices. The key innovation is the use of individual out-of-time prediction errors to measure price changes. The data used in this study consist of 29,998 commercial real estate transactions in New York, in the period 2000--2019. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy is higher for the ML models compared to linear models. On the other hand, ML algorithms depend more on the data used for calibration; they produce less stable results when applied to small samples and may exhibit estimation bias. Hence, measures to reduce or eliminate bias need to be implemented, taking into consideration the bias and variance trade-off.},

  abstract = {Policies of urban containment are widely used in land-use planning and as a means of reducing urban sprawl and of preserving farmland. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge about the effects of urban-containment boundaries on house prices. It is concluded that urban containment programs do affect land prices, and that housing producers do not always respond to higher land prices by increasing the density of development. In relation to aggregate housing prices, the effects of urban containment policy depend on factors such as style of policy implementation, local housing markets, and pattern of land ownership. The demand side of the housing market may be a stronger determinant of prices than local urban containment policies. Nevertheless, it is concluded that local planners can play a significant role in relation to the severity of housing price inflation attributable to urban containment policies.},

  abstract = {This article examines tenant exploitation and landlord profit margins within residential rental markets. Defining exploitation as being overcharged relative to the market value of a property, the authors find exploitation of tenants to be highest in poor neighborhoods. Landlords in poor neighborhoods also extract higher profits from housing units. Property values and tax burdens are considerably lower in depressed residential areas, but rents are not. Because landlords operating in poor communities face more risks, they hedge their position by raising rents on all tenants, carrying the weight of social structure into price. Since losses are rare, landlords typically realize the surplus risk charge as higher profits. Promoting a relational approach to the analysis of inequality, this study demonstrates how the market strategies of landlords contribute to high rent burdens in low-income neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Income inequality and house prices have risen sharply in developed countries during 1975--2010. In line with theoretical models, we argue that this co-movement is no coincidence, but that inequality has driven up house prices on the grounds that it raises the aggregate demand for housing. Our results suggest that absolute inequality and house prices in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were positively correlated and cointegrated, whereas relative inequality and mean income were not significant long-run determinants. This finding indicates that the surge in OECD house prices in part can be explained by a top-income-induced increase in housing demand, and that it is important to consider the interaction of rising mean income and its relative distribution when studying potential correlates of house prices. Moreover, our results confirm previous findings that the short-term real interest rate also is an important correlate of house prices.},

It applies these methods to examine a data sample of about 40,000 housing transactions in a period of over 18~years in Hong Kong, and then compares the results of these algorithms. In terms of predictive power, RF and GBM have achieved better performance when compared to SVM. The three performance metrics including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) associated with these two algorithms also unambiguously outperform those of SVM. However, our study has found that SVM is still a useful algorithm in data fitting because it can produce reasonably accurate predictions within a tight time constraint. Our conclusion is that machine learning offers a promising, alternative technique in property valuation and appraisal research especially in relation to property price prediction.},

Design/methodology/approach -- Qualitative data from a sample of 27 professionals engaged in higher education in the USA are gathered by recorded interview before being transcribed and imported into MAXQDA 2007 software for analytical coding. Findings -- Particular differences are found to exist between renters and buyers with regard to specific service attributes -- for example, description of properties and type of visuals during the pre-purchase stage, knowledge/experience and honest behavior of realtors during the service encounter stage and a continuous relationship with the realtor in the post-encounter stage. Research limitations/implications -- Generalization of the results is limited because the study utilizes data from only one industry (real estate) and from only one demographic segment (professionals in higher education). Practical implications -- Real-estate firms need to pay attention to both the training of agents and the design and content of their websites. Originality/value -- This paper contributes to knowledge regarding virtual servicescapes in professional services.},
